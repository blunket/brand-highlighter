# Brand Highlighter

This is a simple browser extension intended to highlight products on several online stores based on a list of flagged brand names. Currently it supports Walmart.com. Amazon.com support is a work in progress.

In the future, I plan to add settings so the user will be able to manage the brand list themself.
